ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Marcelino but you can call me Marsea...

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in front-end web development...

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning html, css (Bootstrap), and JavaScript (React)...

ðŸ“« How to reach me, Discord (xProtocall#7204) if not on here...

I've been learning front-end web development on my own since September 2021. Learning anything new without any guidance can be scary, so I told myself 
that wasn't entirely going to be the case with this journey of mine. So to make things a little less scary, you can expect my work to have fun elements 
drawn from movies, video games, anime, books, and cats. I hope you enjoy my projects!
