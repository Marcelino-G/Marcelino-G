## About me
Hello, My name is Marcelino but you may call me Marsea. I am a Psychology graduate who finally took the jump into the coding world and have not regretted it since. My current focus is in front end development, working with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript (React). You can expect my work to have elements drawn from movies, video games, anime, books, and or cats. I hope you enjoy my projects!
