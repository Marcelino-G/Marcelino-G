## 😺 About me
Hello! 

I dove headfirst into software development and found that its endless possibilities satisfy my creative tendencies. Most of my projects begin with the discovery of a new concept, language, or tool and then designing it into a project as a key component. If you'd like to reach out, please don't hesitate to connect with me over at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelino-gamino/). I hope you enjoy my projects!
