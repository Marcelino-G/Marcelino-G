## About me
Hello, My name is Marcelino but you may call me Marsea. I am a psychology graduate who finally took the leap into the coding world and have not regretted it since. My current focus revolves around front-end technologies like HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript (React). Other languages I am eager to learn someday are C#, C++, and Python. You can expect my projects to have references from movies, video games, anime, books and or cats to lessen the sometimes scary and intimidating building processes. Aside from coding, I enjoy bobbing my head to a nice hardcore punk riff and rewatching Malcolm in the Middle episodes. Anyways, please do not hesitate to share any ideas, comments, or suggestions. I hope you enjoy my projects!
