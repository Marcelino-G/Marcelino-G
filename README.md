## ğŸ˜º About me
Hello! 

I'm a psychology graduate who dove headfirst into software development because I found the endless possibilities it offers satisfy my creative tendencies. My endeavor began by learning and creating projects related to the front-end for several months before transitioning to the back-end once I became a Tech Elevator student under their full-stack boot camp. Most of my projects begin by discovering a new concept/language/tool and then designing it into an outline to become a key component in an application. You can expect these projects to have references from movies, anime, cats, etc, to lessen the sometimes intimidating building processes. Please do not hesitate to connect or share any ideas, comments, or suggestions. I hope you enjoy my projects!
