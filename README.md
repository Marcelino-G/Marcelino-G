## About me
Hello, 

My name is Marcelino but you may call me Marcy. I am a psychology graduate who dove head first into the world of web development and have not looked back since. My current focus revolves around the front end aspect of development like HTML, CSS (Bootstrap and Sass/SCSS), Javascript (React), and even a little Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Other technologies I hope to someday learn are C#, C++, and Python. All my projects begin by first discovering a new concept and then trying to understand and implement it. You can expect these projects to have references from movies, anime, cats, etc to lessen the sometimes intimidating building processes. When I'm not working with code, I'm probably bobbing my head to a nice guitar riff, rewatching Malcolm in the Middle episodes, or playing video games. Anyways, please do not hesitate to share any ideas, comments, or suggestions. I hope you enjoy my projects!
